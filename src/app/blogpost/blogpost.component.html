      <!-- <p>Hi, My name is Faisal and this is my first blog. I have been a programmer for the more than a year now and whatever they tell you about the world of&nbsp; Programming is absolutely true. It is MAGNIFICENT!<br><br>I have a Bachelors in Civil Engineering, which soon after completing, I realized was not the best fit for me. The right fit for&nbsp; me, you guessed it, was programming.<br><br>Alright, enough about me. Let''s get right down to it. THINGS EVERY ASPIRING PROGRAMMER SHOULD&nbsp; KNOW.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v-iDa_qicuI/XGVCCr0y1LI/AAAAAAAACv8/LGlFT63qNCcxHFQ1MPs6Wmojd9rfnvw3ACLcBGAs/s640/DeveloperProblems.jpg"></figure><h3><strong>Goal</strong></h3><p>The questions you should ask yourself when deciding to dive into the world of programming are these, "Do I really want to be programmer?". "Is this something that I want to do for the rest of my life?".</p><p>If the answer to either of these questions is "No", then in the terms of coding, your function should return or throw an exception right here. What I mean is, you should stop here and find your muse. If you choose to disregard all that and try Programming anyway, chances are that you may get to like it, but there''s a good chance that it doesn''t grow on you.</p><p>What I want to say is that you need to have a clear head before committing.</p><h3><strong>Patience Patience Patience</strong></h3><p>Since you have continued reading this article I believe that you''re set on becoming a programmer. Well, welcome to the club.</p><p><i>"Good things in life come to those who wait."&nbsp;</i></p><p>This saying doesn''t hold true in many contexts but in this one, it does.</p><p>I won''t be going into technical details about which field to pursue because, believe me, there are a lot of fields to choose from. What I will tell you is that whatever field you choose, you need to be patient with it as well as yourself. It''s not all ''raindrops on roses and whispers on kittens''. It''s a little different than that. It may take you days to build a simple program that counts the number of prime number less that 100, which other programmer may build in minutes. The the important thing is that you build that program. There''s no time limit. It''s not a competition. You''re a winner if you just cross the finish line.</p><h3><strong>Don''t set deadlines</strong></h3><p>One of the common questions that I get asked by every aspiring programmer is this, "How long will it take me to become a programmer?" I have got just one reply, "As long as it takes you".</p><p>Stop setting deadlines. If you really want to learn programming, you''re not going to cheat. Simple! So it will take you as long as it takes you. Stay true to yourself and keep learning. There will come a time when you are confident enough to say that, "Alright, I think I''m ready to showcase my skills now." This could mean that you''re ready to take up a programming job, take an entrance exam, an aptitude test for further studies, etc.</p><p>The important thing is that you get to decide when you''re ready. No one else knows you better than you know yourself, so give yourself that.</p><h3><strong>Where to Start</strong></h3><p>Okay. The first step. The most important one, right? Well, let me tell you my story.</p><p>When I decided to become a programmer, my first step was to learn Object Oriented Programming. Three days in, I got lost. I had taken the wrong first step. How did I know this? Well the next step that I took was the right one, that''s how. So, don''t sweat. It''s okay to take a wrong first step.</p><p>Nonetheless, this is what your first step should be. Highly subjective, but I believe that it fits most scenarios. You should first decide on a language. There are many articles on choosing your first language and this one isn''t about that.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-%CA%87d%C4%B1%C9%B9%C9%94s%C9%90%CA%8C%C9%90%C9%BE-%C9%B9%C7%9D%CA%8Dsu%C9%90-19a33b0a467d">Here''s one</a></p><p>&nbsp;that you might find helpful.</p><h3><strong>Learning the Language</strong></h3><p>Start from the absolute basics. Take up a tutorial course, paid or free you choose, and start learning. Keep in mind that the course should be for absolute beginners. Even if you have some experience in programming from you childhood days or something, you have to start from the absolute basics. Sometimes, the basics may surprise you.</p><h3><strong>Practice Practice and Practice some more.</strong></h3><p>Deciding a language and learning it is important. What''s more important is what you do with it. Start writing programs. Programs that print out first 20 prime numbers. Programs that reverse a word. Programs that decide whether a year is a leap year... The possibilities are endless. You should be obsessed with writing code. Well obsessed is a strong word, but you should be walking code, talking code, eating code and sleeping code. Basically what I mean is that, in your initial learning phase, you should really invest yourself in programming.</p><p>You have to keep writing code if you want to keep improving. It''s a simple equation. Get a T-shirt that says that! :D</p><p>Well, that''s about it. I''m not a successful programmer yet, but I do know a thing or two about the struggles that aspiring programmers have to face. So, if you keep all these points in mind, I promise you that the journey that you have embarked upon will be a little less difficult.</p><p>So, best of luck and see you on the other side!</p>  </div> -->
